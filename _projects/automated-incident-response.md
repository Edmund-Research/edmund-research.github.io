## Problem Statement
Manual incident response leads to delays and inconsistency.  
When runtime threats emerge in production environments, automated containment minimizes downtime and risk.

## Approach
- Deployed a **Kubernetes** cluster instrumented with **Falco** to detect abnormal system calls.  
- Integrated **Prometheus** for metric collection and **Grafana** for visualization.  
- Configured **Ansible playbooks** to automatically isolate compromised pods or revoke access tokens.  
- Used **AWS Lambda** and **Slack API** to push real-time alerts and trigger remediation actions.

## Tools Used
Falco, Prometheus, Grafana, Ansible, AWS Lambda, Slack API.

## Key Lessons Learned
- Automation can reduce mean time to response (MTTR) by over 60%.  
- Combining detection and orchestration tools creates self-healing infrastructure.  
- Security automation should complement—not replace—human oversight.
