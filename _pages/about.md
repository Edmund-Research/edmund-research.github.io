Hi, I’m **Edmund Chege**, an Infrastructure Engineer passionate about **automation**, **security**, and **reliability**.

I bridge the gap between operations and development by designing and maintaining systems that scale — from bare-metal servers to Kubernetes clusters. My focus is on **secure orchestration**, **CI/CD optimization**, and **infrastructure resilience**.

### 🧠 Skills
- Kubernetes, Docker, Helm  
- Terraform, Ansible, GitHub Actions  
- AWS, Azure, GCP  
- Security hardening & compliance  
- Monitoring & Observability (Prometheus, Grafana)

### 💬 Philosophy
> “Infrastructure should empower developers, not constrain them.”

Outside of work, I enjoy contributing to open-source tools and mentoring new engineers in cloud automation and DevSecOps.
