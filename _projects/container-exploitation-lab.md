## Problem Statement
Containers accelerate delivery but can mask vulnerabilities â€” outdated base images, weak network policies, or exposed secrets.  
Understanding how attackers exploit these weaknesses builds empathy for security design.

## Approach
- Built a vulnerable **FastAPI** microservice container with intentional flaws.  
- Deployed it to **Kubernetes** using misconfigured manifests (open ports, permissive roles).  
- Scanned the cluster using **Kube-Hunter** and **Kubescape**, then exploited the app via **Burp Suite** and **OWASP ZAP**.  
- Applied CIS Kubernetes benchmark controls and re-tested to validate mitigations.

## Tools Used
Docker, Kubernetes, Kube-Hunter, Kubescape, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, FastAPI.

## Key Lessons Learned
- Practical exposure to common Kubernetes and container attack vectors.  
- Importance of network policies and image scanning in CI/CD pipelines.  
- Hardened manifests significantly reduce lateral movement risk.
