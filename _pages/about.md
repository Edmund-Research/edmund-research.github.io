## 👋 Hi, I’m Edmund Chege

I’m an **Infrastructure Engineer** with a passion for building scalable, secure, and observable systems.  
From bare metal to the cloud, I enjoy creating infrastructure that’s as **automated and resilient** as the workloads it supports.

---

## 🧱 My Focus

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform, Ansible, and Helm for predictable, versioned environments.  
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes and CI/CD automation for seamless deployments.  
- **Security:** Integrating compliance and monitoring into infrastructure workflows.  

---

## 🔐 Expanding into Ethical Hacking

I’m currently pursuing a **course in Ethical Hacking**, which deepens my understanding of **system vulnerabilities, network defense, and secure architecture design**.

This complements my infrastructure work by helping me:
- Anticipate and mitigate potential attack vectors early in the design phase.  
- Align infrastructure automation with **defense-in-depth** principles.  
- Build a stronger bridge between **operations, development, and security**.  

My goal is to create infrastructure that’s not only **efficient and automated**, but also **secure by design**.

## 🌍 Beyond the Console

When I’m not debugging clusters or automating deployments, you’ll find me:
- Reading about distributed systems and cybersecurity trends.  
- Experimenting with open-source tools.  
- Sharing lessons learned through technical writing and collaboration.
